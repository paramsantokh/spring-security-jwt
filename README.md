# spring-security-jwt

This is a demo application to show how JWT(Jason Web Token) authenticate requests.

# How To Use
Do a POST request to below url with AuthenticationRequest in body:

http://localhost:8080/authenticate

**AuthenticationRequest**:

{
   "userName": "user",	
   "password": "user"	
}

In response jwt-token will be returned. copy this token to use later.

Do a GET to below url:

http://localhost:8080/hello

Below message will be returned:
 >"message": "Access Denied",
  
Now post same request with Authorization: Bearer jwt-token in headers

http://localhost:8080/hello
>Hello World!! 

If above response returned, jwt authenticated the request successfully.
